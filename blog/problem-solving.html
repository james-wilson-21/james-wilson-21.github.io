        <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
        <h3>You got a problem?</h3>
        <p>An example from the last sprint we just did was problem solving some of the Kata. In particular the 
            Kata on in-built JavaScript Methods. I wouldn't say I solved them in very elegant ways as there's nothing
        very elegant about the way I code. I mostly bludgeon away with quick fire solutions until something sticks. In a lot of
        these cases the tried and true methods weren't cutting the mustard. So I took my time with a lot of them and trialled and 
        errored as well as employed the use of Google and stack overflow to figure out a lot of the solutions. My biggest issues 
        often is going too fast and not checking in with things like variables and scope.</p>

        <h3>Psuedocode</h3>
        <p>A programmer looking to deal with a particular problem may run the steps in prose before translating those
            steps into the targetted programming language.</p>
        <h3>The rubber ducky method</h3>
        <p>Explaining the problem to someone, anyone, or anything may and sometimes does help the person resolve the
            problem once they have explained the problem in it's entirety, out loud.
            It helps the explainer teach the problem and themselves, more fully understand it..</p>
            <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
            <p>Interesting to read messages from the bottom up in Javascript to see where it starts,
                where our code ends -- where the problem is 
                where the the third party (JS Libraries etc) code is throwing the error message
                And the error message itself at the top</p>

                <h3>Console.logging:</h3>
        <p>I fully endorse this. It's become my go to for why things aren't working. Maybe there's a better way. If so let me know what it</p>
            <h3>Googling:</h3>
            <p>Google here is my exact problem, give me answers from Stack Overflow and all that good stuff.
                Good way to see who else has encountered this problem in the past and if someone can shine some 
                light on it. Be careful that your problem is actually this, or you could spend hours searching for
                something that is not your actual problem.</p>

                <h3>Other methods...</h3>
                <p>Asking other, asking mentors, trying ANYTHING: all of these methods are there to use when all else fails. Really anything is better than 
                    giving up. Oh and if YOU have the answers, pay it forward. You'll help someone out and feel better at the same time. WIN!
