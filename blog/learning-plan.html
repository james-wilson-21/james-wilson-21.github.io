<h1>My Learning Plan, Goals and Committments</h1>
<p>For me, I'd really like to work for myself developing software. I'd love to make the games I'd like to play and tell the stories I want to 
    see in digital form.</p>

<p>In terms of strengths and weaknesses, I tend to get bogged down in the detail too much and it can really affect my time management. Also I can 
    really take on way too much... Case in point my working while studying for foundations, I tend to underestimate my workload...
    Other than that I have a real knack for digital technology and not too bad at problem solving being able to come to a solution through critical 
    and abstract thought. Also I am dedicated to finishing tasks that I start.</p>

<p>During this course I would like to work on my assertiveness. I really care about other and like to give everyone the benefit of the doubt, at the cost of being walked over somewhat when people can see that I'm
    willing to do whatever is needed without question.</p>

<h2>My Committment:</h2>

<p>I will work to the best of my ability to keep to task and maintain communication with my colleagues, facilitators and other representatives 
    while being aware of the needs and safety of others.</p>


<p>I will be aware of when things are getting on top of me and be mindful to take regular breaks and be aware of when things are potentially getting out of hand.
    In these cases I will talk to my colleagues and explain that I require help or time to step back.</p>
    
<p>I expect to be able to receive help, where reasonable, as things are explained. I am not the most vocal person, so I may need to be checked in on that things are going
    okay.</p>
    
<p>I (like everyone else) have personal issues in my life where things aren't always running smoothly. Five hours from home to do this course, so any committments will be
    done over the phone. I am committed to dedicating myself to this course and seeing that I take full advantage of the opportunities it is presenting me and will keep a 
    healthy balance of keeping home issues such as communication outside of class hours.
    Save for emergencies of course... :)</p>
