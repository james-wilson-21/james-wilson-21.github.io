<h1>My Learning Plan, Goals and Committments</h1>

<p>For me, I'd really like to work for myself developing software. I'd love to make the games I'd like to play and tell the stories I want to 
    see in digital form.</p>

<p>In terms of strengths and weaknesses, I tend to get bogged down in the detail too much and it can really affect my time management. Also I can 
    really take on way too much... Case in point my working while studying for foundations, I tend to underestimate my workload...
    Other than that I have a real knack for digital technology and not too bad at problem solving being able to come to a solution through critical 
    and abstract thought. Also I am dedicated to finishing tasks that I start.</p>

<p>During this course I would like to work on my assertiveness. I really care about others and like to give everyone the benefit of the doubt, at the cost of being walked over somewhat when people can see that I'm
    willing to do whatever is needed without question.</p>

<h2>My Committment:</h2>

<p>I will work to the best of my ability to keep to task and maintain communication with my colleagues, facilitators and other representatives 
    while being aware of the needs and safety of others.</p>


<p>I will be aware of when things are getting on top of me and be mindful to take regular breaks and be aware of when things are potentially getting out of hand.
    In these cases I will talk to my colleagues and explain that I require help or time to step back.</p>
    
<p>I expect to be able to receive help, where reasonable, as things are explained. I am not the most vocal person, so I may need to be checked in on that things are going
    okay.</p>
    
<p>I (like everyone else) have personal issues in my life where things aren't always running smoothly. Five hours from home to do this course, so any committments will be
    done over the phone. I am committed to dedicating myself to this course and seeing that I take full advantage of the opportunities it is presenting me and will keep a 
    healthy balance of keeping home issues such as communication outside of class hours.
    Save for emergencies of course... :)</p>

    <h1>Pre-bootcamp Learning Plan Update</h1>
    <p>- I am keen to hit the ground running once I finish bootcamp. I want to get my foot in the door somewhere, but I want it be as a developer, rather than just on the helpdesk.
        My long term goal is still developing my own software and programmes, but I want to get in somewhere where I can contribute and build those skills making great stuff with 
        great people!
    </p>
    <p>- I have to stay on task and prioritise what needs finishing! I still like to keep touching programmes when they are finished but not to my satisfaction. I need to speak up more
        when I'm struggling also and not when I get behind.
    </p>
    <p>- As well as my original plan, I'd like develop new ways at looking at problems, and adjusting my mindset to tackle them, rather than using the same old tools I always do. 
        Leadership skills too, as I tend to find my opinion sought and remain a deer in the headlights.

    </p>
    <p>- I'm keen for the Bootcamp team to keep on me if I clam up and am deep in the screen trying and failing at something. And to challenge me.

    </p>
    <p>- I will keep to task and focus on getting my commitments finished in a timely manner.<br>- I will ask for help when I need it and have exhausted my attempts at solving the issue. 
    <br>- I will look to my bootcamp leaders for support when I need it either with tech or core issues and make sure to check in on myself.
