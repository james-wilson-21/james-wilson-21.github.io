        <h2>Identity and Values</h2>
        <h3>A snapshot of my ethics & Values...</h3>
        <p>Having worked public libraries I have had a number of ethical dilemmas to deal with. As a PSA representative, my manager brought 
            to light an example of a coworker(1) complaining privately via email to her on anothers(2) behalf against a third party member(3) of alleged bullying.
            Worker 2 came to me stressed out about the complaint fearing for the outcome and descendiing into an anxiety attack. Working with 3, I knew
            that my manager was taking care of that issue and working through things with 3 and I didn't 
            want to explain the situation of what 1 did to 2 as that would have made things quite messy, so when asked by 1 what was happening with 2, I mentioned 
            that she was upset over a professional issue. 1 knew I was a PSA representative and went into damage control and went to help 1 out of her stress.
            I weighed up the confidentiality of the situation against what could allow the parties affected to minimise their stress and realise the consequences of their
            own actions at the same time. I'm still unsure if my methods were ideal... </p>
        <h3>My background...</h3>
        <p>I come from a bit of a mixed maori and pakeha background... My parents came from big strict families and I was brought up with those pakeha values as well.
            It shaped me in weird ways, where I know right and wrong and try to balance my own moral compass against that and what every situation brings.
            I am quite libaral minded, but as a I get older (and where I have lived), many of those views get challenged (even within myself).</p>

        <h3>How I rule and how I suck...</h3>
        <p> I have discovered a lot about myself in the various jobs, roles and relationships I have encountered over the years. I have a mix of analysis and creativity
            within me that has shaped my work ethic, how I tackle problems and how I engage with everything. I got some of this from the HBDI test I did last year for work.
            What I tend to lack is in both organisation and interpersonal emotion (especially under stress). Creatively this may help with problem solving, but I can see how I may
            struggle when collaborating with others as I am not the most assertive person also. 
            
            Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with 
            others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, 
            how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.
            
            Having done a number of escape rooms, I tend to lean back and go along with the majority a lot, so as not to hurt anyones feelings (and probably save myself some personal grief too).
            This I can see has led to many failed room exits on time, but also frustration amongst members of the group as me (and others my ilk) tend to stand back and watch as time ticks by and 
            we wrangle with when a safe time to contribute presents itself. Reflecting on other strategies, asking and presenting my opinion can only benefit the group. If not with the correct answer,
            perhaps to get someone else's mind working or if not, eliminate that possiblity if another was thinking it also.</p>
