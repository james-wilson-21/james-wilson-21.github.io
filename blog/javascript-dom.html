        <h3>The difference between HTML & CSS be like...</h3>
        <p>In political terms HTML and CSS can be seen as a campaign team and 
            illustrated in a campaign speech. The HTML part of the team would
            be the policy consultant who keep the speech on message. The 
            central party message would be there. The politicians aims for a better
            tomorrow, lowering taxes, trains on time blah blah 
        </p>
        <p>The CSS part of the team would be the campaign manager, making sure each
            of the policy writers parts of the speech would be peppy, with witty anecdotes 
            and entertaining digs at the oposition. It would have flourishes of 
            colourful language and with beautiful imaginative allusions to tomorrow and
            some lovely links to everyday life for the voter to latch on to.
        </p>
        <h3>Control Flow and Loops be like...</h3>
        <p>An example of flow control in 'everyday life' would be going to work everyday.
            The idea is to successfully make it to work, do your daily mahi and make it back 
            home in a timely manner. This flow is achieved by some orderly structure, logic and Loops
            to ensure that: while the time is between 8.30am and 5pm you can go to work,
            IF you are fully dressed AND have your lunch. Unless (else if) you are sick you get to stay
            home. Otherwise (else) you aren't ready for work (or are trying to get fired).
        </p>
        <h3>What is the DOM?</h3>
        <p>The (HTML) DOM, or Document Object Model, is an interface that works similar to a tree 
            model where each node(element) is an object representing part of the model. It is the standard
            for how to get, change, add or delete HTML elements, where the easiest way to get to the content
            of the element is by using the 'innerHTML' property.
            Interacting with DOMas a developer can be done by using your browser Development Tools. As a user,
            something as simple as using a slider on a webpage to change the value of an element can be done (eg.
            make an image biger or smaller, change the colour value of an element etc.).
        </p>
        <h3>Accessing data from Arrays and Objects</h3>
        <p>Basically, an array is indexed by the position of the values, and is accessed as such. E.g. if the BMW is the third 
            value in the array, you don't say "Gimme that BMW!". Instead you have to ask for the third value 
            in that array of cars, or since it's an array value: [2]. Objects are lettered index and the object (or values within
            the object) can be accessed in different ways. So to rehash my example: mycars.car2 = bmw or mycars['car2'] = bmw.
        </p>
        <h3>What's a function</h3>
        <p>If you're familiar with other object oriented languages you could say that functions perform the same way as 'methods' do.
            Literally they are a block of code that performs a distinct function (... woah, just like the name!). They can then be called 
            (invoked, hailed... whatevers) from somewhere else, or something else in the script.</p>
            <p>Functions are super useful because you can use them more than once. Have code that can change the colour of something? Cool! 
                Call your colorChange() function. Need to change it back later? Awesome, call it again with a different parameter! 
            </p>
