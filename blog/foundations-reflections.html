        <h2>Foundations Reflection</h2>
            <h3><em>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</em></h3>
                <p>I've learnt that I need to take on a lot less and focus on what I need to get done rather than trying to do everything, 
                    which is somewhat something that I realised early on as well. I've also learnt that just knowing code isn't enough to 
                    work around problems. I've learnt that looking at problems for what they rather than just trying to <em>code</em> my
                    way around them is not enough. The ego is a fragile thing, and mine is no different, so coming up against a brick wall
                    can be incredibly humbling. But pushing through and persisting is not only satisfying but feels like real growth for me.
                </p>
            <h3><em>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</em>></h3>
                <p>I feel that these values are important and are real sign of growing emotional intelligence. Really understanding who I am can 
                    help me work well myself, but give me a sense of how well I can learn and programme with others. 
                </p>
            <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
                <p>The depth of insight into both neuroplasticity and emotional intelligence deepened what I already thought I understood about both
                    of things. Also the different aspects of the growth and fixed mindsets. I hadn't really thought about their definitions before and 
                    what they meant at their core, so I found that interesting. I really hope that things like this are built upon in the bootcamp :)
                </p>
            <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
                <p>Digging deep within yourself to admit a lot of things about how I learn can be very confronting, raw and sobering. Not being the most 
                    vocal person as well as being quite the introvert, I find it a little exhausting doing things like this and in the past have 
                    written many of these kind of activites off as a <em>necessary evil</em>. But with this I felt like it was more focussed and 
                    something I looked forward to doing for each sprint. With that though came a lot of learning about stuff I haven't thought about 
                    in the past.
                </p>
            <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
                <p>I think you have mentioned it quite frequently yourselves. It's really an important part of (not only) software development companies 
                    and acquiring the the kind of people that they want. It takes more than just dudes who know how to code. Being able to work alone 
                    and in a group, functioning as cohesive units and getting along with one another with empathy and emotional intelligence prevents projects 
                    and teams failing, people not getting along and people staying on board because they know themselves and others enough to get along and
                    contribute positively.
                </p>
            <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
            <p>I'm not going to lie and say it was all super useful stuff that I get down on my hands and knees and thank the heavens for this content...<br>
                Some of it I was happy to blast through so I could catch up on my programming. But even online, I had some of the most enjoyable parts listening
                & looping and talking about some of the hardships of learning code with my colleagues. I never would have experienced that if not for the core
                content.<br>
                As I said though, even things like the the Learning plan (which as of this blog post I have yet to finish off for the course beginning), I 
                could take or leave, but that is mainly because I do a lot of written and typed plans, but struggle to stick with and (to the chagrin of my partner)
                leave lying around the house, unutilised.
            </p>
