        <h2>Neuroplasticity & the Growth Mindset</h2>
        <h3>How Understanding the Principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
        <p>The change and growth of the neural networks in the brain by either making new connections (or pathways) or creating new ones
            is a key factor to know for people wishing to work on or learn a new skill in whatever field they desire.
            
            -People are able then to learn and achieve new things through practice to keep neuralpathways open. 
            -Improve exiesting pathways 
            -The value of repitition in training those pathways
            -the value of intense work and practice in working on a skill 
            -taking the time to work on new and existing skills and understanding the time between sessions
            -Knowing which parts of the skill acquisition is important and not overloading with too much input
            </p>
        <h2>engaging with the principles of neuroplasticity</h2>
        <p>Repitition is important and setting a time and period of frequency to work on a new or existing skill will aid me in being able to
            improve my skills in Web and software development. It will also aid me in focussing on those skills which I can recognise are of 
            greater value for what I want to achieve instead of overloading myself and trying to info dump my brain to less effect.
            </p>
        <h2>What is a growth mindset?</h2>
        <p>Growth mindset is the engagement of someone who believes that with a desire to get smarter they can recognise that effort and time they put
            in will lead to achievment.
            The opposite of this is the fixed mindset, where a person believes that there skills and intelligence are fixed with no room left to grow.
            A growth mindset allows people to learn new skills and improve in areas they set there mind to. This can be influenced both within and without 
            through environmental factors. Similarly the fixed mindset can be affected, for example, in telling a child that they are intelligent or smart, can 
            encourge a fixed mindset.</p>
        <h2>Points of Interest</h2>
        <p>It was interesting learning about the nature of the concepts. I have always had a growth mindset about learning new things and keeping an open
            mind about new skills and challenges. My mind tended to lean toward 'studying' up about something to learn about it, which kind of leads toward 
            'fixing' the knowledge within me, which would go against the idea of neuroplasticity.
            </p>
        <h2>Applying it to my learning journey</h2>
        <p>I think it will help me with problem solving the most. I think that if I run into an issue that I really struggle with I can reframe it into,
            something I may not necessarily be able to solve 'right now', but can solve eventually.
